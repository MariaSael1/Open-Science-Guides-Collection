      <p><strong>Target group:</strong> public health masters students, health community, policy and system designers.</p>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Guide for Masters course.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The guide is an introduction to the difference between equality and equity. Firstly it explains the difference in terms of how society hands out resources and opportunities using the USA 1960 example <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Tree" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Tree">The Giving Tree</a></em> is an American children's picture book written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. The core idea being that society is not a natural system and has inbuilt rewards that prioritize social groups.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Equity is a solution for addressing imbalanced social systems. Justice can take equity one step further by fixing the systems in a way that leads to long-term, sustainable, equitable access for generations to come.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The guide then shows example recommendations from leading health institutions and how thes define the topic: for example here with The World Health Organization (WHO) and how <a href="https://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/equity/en/" title="https://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/equity/en/">equity is defined</a>; US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) refers to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/strategies2016/index.html" title="https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/strategies2016/index.html">health equity</a>; and here as the <a href="http://viablefuturescenter.org/racemattersinstitute/" title="http://viablefuturescenter.org/racemattersinstitute/">Race Matters Institute</a> desribes.</p>
      <p>The guide then shows examples of how equality and equity differ in policy, for example: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Equality - A city cuts the budget for 25 community centers by reducing the operational hours for all centers by the same amount at the same times. <br>Equity - The city determines which times and how many hours communities actually need to use their community centers and reduces hours for centers that aren't used as frequently.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Short case studies of programs are described and given a list of additional resources.</p>

      <p><strong>Target group:</strong> The target audience of this book are people who want to research basic information and the possibilities of Open Science. Furthermore, Open Science should be accessible to everyone and everyone should have equal rights.</p>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> Recommendations for Practice, LIS study.</p>
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In Knowledge Justice, scholars from various ethnic backgrounds draw on critical race theory to challenge the fundamental principles, values ​​and assumptions of library and information science in the United States. This is intended to lead the profession to understand how "white" supremacy affects practices, services, curricula, spaces, and policies.</p>
      <p>The authors describe that a misconception of the neutrality and objectivity of library and information science comes from the influence of the different ethnicities of scholars. Through in-depth analyzes of library and archival collections, scholarly communication, power hierarchies, epistemic domination, children's libraries, teaching and learning, digital humanities, and the education system, Knowledge Justice calls for the abolition of so-called "white supremacy" in order to create racial justice for every group of people.</p>
